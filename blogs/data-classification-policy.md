	•	Default Classification - All information in use at [Insert Company Name] that has not been made public by its owner nor given a sensitive classification (e.g., restricted) by its owner or in this policy is considered to be internal use only. Information owners must actively elect to classify any information under their control as sensitive. PCI and ePHI data are considered restricted; see “Classifications” below.

	•	Policy
The value and inherent risk of information shall be determined, classified and managed in accordance with [Insert Company Name] information security protocols. Controls to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information shall be consistent with the assigned classification and data management standards. Accidental disclosure, theft, and uncontrolled dissemination are among the risks involved in handling sensitive information. This policy establishes [Insert Company Name]’s data classification scheme, and provides direction as to the appropriate handling of information.


	•	Policy Attributes
	•	Introduction
Addresses Major Risks: [Insert Company Name]’s data classification policy has been designed to support the need to know so that information will be protected from unauthorized disclosure, use, modification, and deletion. Consistent use of this data classification system will facilitate business activities and help keep the costs for information security to a minimum. Without using this data classification system consistently, [Insert Company Name] risks loss of customer relationships, loss of public confidence, operational disruption, excessive costs, and competitive disadvantage.

Applicability: This data classification policy is applicable to all information in [Insert Company Name]’s possession or control. For example, sensitive information entrusted to [Insert Company Name] by consumers, suppliers, business partners, and others must be protected according to this data classification policy. Employees are expected to protect third party information with the same care that they protect [Insert Company Name] information.  

Consistent Protection: Information must be consistently protected throughout its life cycle, from its origination to its destruction.  Information must be protected according to its sensitivity, no matter where it resides, what form it takes, what technology was used to handle it, and what purpose(s) it serves. Although this policy provides overall guidance, to achieve consistent information protection, Employees will be expected to apply and extend these concepts to fit the needs of day-to-day operations. 

Determination of Sensitivity: In acknowledging the nature of a modern workplace, no attempt is made to classify all data transitioning [Insert Company Name] information systems. Unless certain types of information are pre-classified (see PCI/ePHI below), it is otherwise the sole responsibility of each information owner to classify any data under their control.

Trade Secrets: As a condition of continued employment at [Insert Company Name], employees must diligently protect [Insert Company Name] information specifically identified as trade secrets from unauthorized disclosure. Trade secrets must be identified as such by their owner prior to being disclosed to an Employee. Trade secrets are classified as Restricted information.



	•	Data Classifications
Data classification is the categorization of information based on its level of impact to [Insert Company Name]. Information Assets with the highest risks require the additional protection to prevent compromises, while assets with lower risk are assigned protection commensurate to the expected impact.

To determine the appropriate level of security controls required for [Insert Company Name]’s Information Assets, data should be classified into a category (Restricted, Internal Use Only, or Public), according to the sensitivity level of the information.

7.2.1 	Restricted
This classification applies to sensitive business information that is intended strictly for use within [Insert Company Name]. Its unauthorized disclosure could seriously and adversely impact [Insert Company Name], its business partners, vendors and/or customers. Due to the sensitive nature of this information, access to Restricted data should be controlled from creation to destruction, and only granted to people (or systems) with a specific business need. A high level of security controls, including a restrictive set of access rights/privileges should be applied.

Examples of Restricted data include:
	•	Personally identifiable information (PII); 
	•	Internal financial documents;
	•	Merger & Acquisition information;
	•	Credit card and billing information;
	•	Source code;
	•	Intellectual Property (e.g., research data);
	•	Encryption keys;
	•	Passwords;
	•	Customer data (e.g., incident information, post mortem specifics, etc.).

Examples of impact of Restricted data loss includes:
	•	Loss of Customers – the safety of consumer information is called into question;
	•	Increased government or customer oversight - mandatory consent decrees, customer audits, security evaluations;
	•	Monetary penalties or imprisonment - legal action from neglect of maintaining proper security controls.

7.2.2 	Internal Use Only
This classification applies to [Insert Company Name] information that is not clearly confidential or restricted but is also not intended for public use. Internal Use Only data applies to information that could result in indirect or limited impact to our customers, business partners, suppliers or other stakeholders, if disclosed without authorization. Internal Use Only data is categorized as internal business information that should have standard security controls to ensure access is limited to authorized personnel. Information in this classification is sensitive where the negative impact, if lost, could cause some financial loss and a delay in business performance.

Examples of Internal Use Only data include:
	•	customer transaction records;
	•	legal contracts and confidentiality agreements;
	•	strategic alliance agreements;
	•	compliance audit reports;
	•	meeting minutes and internal memos;
	•	plans and presentations;
	•	general HR information;
	•	Internal emails.

Examples of impact of Internal Use Only data loss includes:
	•	[Insert Company Name]’s reputation is negatively impacted - internal emails leaked
	•	Loss of competitive advantage - media disclosure of internal plans, features, and upcoming product releases
	•	Decrease in customer confidence - disclosure of customer purchases

7.2.3 	Public
Public data applies to information that could result in limited or non-material loss to [Insert Company Name], our customers, business partners, suppliers or other stakeholders, if disclosed without authorization.  Control should be in place to prevent unauthorized modification or destruction of the information to ensure it remains accurate for consumption over time. The integrity of public data should be protected. Therefore, authorization from the Information Owner should be obtained prior to replication or copying.

Examples of Public data include:
	•	product and service brochures;
	•	published annual reports;
	•	advertisements;
	•	job listings;
	•	press releases;
	•	[Insert Company Name] websites;
	•	[Insert Company Name]’s social network sites;
	•	other publicly available information.

Examples of impact of public data loss includes:
	•	Unauthorized replication/likeness of [Insert Company Name]’s website, product interfaces, and blogs;
	•	Misrepresentation of press releases or posting on social networking sites;
	•	Negative media around unauthorized posting to social networks.

	•	Determining Data Classification
Data classifications help to determine the baseline security controls that are appropriate for safeguarding classified information. Classifications set a guideline on the sensitivity and impact to [Insert Company Name] should the information be disclosed, altered, or destroyed without authorization.

7.3.1 	Production Information and Information Owners
Production information must have a designated information owner. Production information is information routinely used to accomplish business objectives. Examples include payroll summaries, shipping schedules, and accounting reports. Information owners are responsible for assigning appropriate sensitivity classifications as defined above.  

7.3.2 	Access Decisions
Information owners must make decisions about who will be permitted to gain access to information, and how the information will be used. Information owners must additionally take steps to ensure that appropriate controls are utilized in the storage, handling, distribution, and usage of information.

7.3.3 	Data Collection
Information Owners may assign a single classification to a collection of data that is common in purpose or function. When classifying a collection of data, the most restrictive classification of any of the individual elements should be applied to the entire collection.

7.3.4 	Reclassification
On a periodic basis, the classification of [Insert Company Name] data should be re-evaluated by the Information Owner to confirm that the assigned classification is still appropriate. Conducting an evaluation on an annual basis is the minimum standard and Information Owners are encouraged to determine the evaluation frequency most appropriate based on the data’s sensitivity and available resources.

If the Information Owner determines the classification of certain data has changed, an analysis of security controls should be performed to determine whether existing controls are consistent with the new classification. If gaps are uncovered in existing security controls, they should be corrected commensurate with the level of risk.

	•	Aggregation and Metadata
When data is aggregated, the impact of a security breach may be materially greater than if only a single element of the data is compromised. As such, Information Owners should classify aggregated data following the principles described below.

There are two types of aggregation, which can raise the sensitivity level of data and therefore affect the controls needed for protection:
	•	Accumulation: Refers to the volume of information stored in one place (e.g., 1,000 records versus 500,000 records).
	•	Association: This occurs when data of little value or low business-impact is combined with other data of a similarly low impact to create information of significantly greater value. 
When accumulation or association occurs, the impact, if the information is compromised, may be elevated.

Similarly, metadata (“data that provides information about other data” stored within documents) may contain sensitive information and thus heighten the security risk associated with the information. Examples of metadata include IP address, GPS information, creation date, modified date, etc. Metadata is a feature of many file and document types (e.g., Microsoft Office documents, PDFs, JPGs, ZIP files, multimedia formats, etc.), and should be considered by Information Owners when classifying information assets.


	•	Data Handling
Records containing sensitive information are obtained where there is a legitimate business need. Where possible, sensitive information should be accessed from its original source, and copies or printed versions of the information kept to a minimum.


7.5.1 Access Control
Need to Know: One of the fundamental principles of information security is the "need to know."  In other words, the information should be disclosed only to those people who have a legitimate business need.  This principle applies to sensitive information, such as source code, litigation strategy and credit card transaction data, just as it applies to internal, limited-distribution information such as marketing research.  

No Unauthorized Declassification: Employees must not declassify information unless this action is formally approved by the information owner.

System Access Controls: Electronic sensitive information must be protected via access controls to ensure that it is not improperly disclosed, modified, or deleted. Access control systems must control access based on need to know, as well as log which users accessed which sensitive data at what time.

Access Granting Decisions: Access to [Insert Company Name] sensitive information must be provided only after expressed authorization of the information owner has been obtained. Custodians of the involved information must refer requests for access to information owners.


7.5.2 Access Review
Access to sensitive information should be controlled through security controls and granted only to [Insert Company Name] personnel who require such access in order to perform their job (“need-to-know”). Access to this type of data should be individually requested and then authorized by the Information Owner.

[Insert Company Name] personnel should receive annual training on their responsibilities regarding appropriate use and steps they can take to protect sensitive information.

Staff with access to sensitive information should be reviewed and documented on a quarterly basis by the information Owners to verify the continued need for access.

7.5.3 Use, Transmission, and Storage
The following controls are required when transmitting, processing or storing of sensitive information:

Transmission
	•	If [Insert Company Name] sensitive data is to be transmitted over any publicly accessible communication network, it must be sent only in encrypted form. Such networks include, but are not limited to email systems, the Internet, wireless, broadband and cellular.
	•	Encrypt sensitive information when (1) placing it on removable media for transfer to other parties; (2) placing it on a mobile computer (e.g., laptops, smart phones, and tablets) for transfer; or (3) classified as Restricted.
	•	Sending sensitive information via instant message, Slack, or unsecured file transfer mechanisms should be avoided, request for sending sensitive information should be sent through the Infosec team.
	•	Transmitting sensitive information to network-connected printing/scanning devices is prohibited, unless they are on a securely encrypted (“closed”) network.

Processing
	•	Discussing or displaying information in an environment where it may be viewed or overheard by unauthorized individuals is prohibited.
	•	When printing, photocopying or faxing, take steps to prevent unauthorized personnel from viewing the output.

Storage
	•	Secure workstations by encrypting laptops that store sensitive information and/or setting automatic locking mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access.
	•	When in areas accessible to unauthorized personnel, ensure keys and access badges are in your possession.
	•	Sensitive information should be stored only on centrally managed network storage devices.
	•	Proprietary research equipment or instruments unable to output data to centrally managed network storage devices should have a periodic backup mechanism that copies the output data onto a centrally managed network storage device.
	•	Store sensitive hardcopy documents in a locked drawer or in another secure location.

 7.5.4 Required Protective Measures
	•	Restricted data should be encrypted, both in transit and at rest, in internal [Insert Company Name] environments and in external third-party environments.
	•	When handling Restricted data, effective masking of data elements temporarily mitigates the immediate risk, thus allowing the display of information to be treated at a lower classification level. However, the underlying information should be treated as Restricted data and encrypted accordingly.
	•	Internal Use Only data in transit with external third-party environments should be encrypted in transit and at rest. This same data in transit in internal environments should be encrypted.
	•	Sensitive information at rest in internal environments and in external third-party environments should be encrypted. By definition, [Insert Company Name] production is a secure environment.

7.5.5	Information Transfer
Electronic Communication Channels
Organization's information may be exchanged through the following electronic communication channels: email, download of files from the Internet, transfer of data via FTP, telephones, fax machines, SMS text messages, portable media, and forums and social networks.

The Head of Infosec determines the communication channel that may be used for each type of information, and possible restrictions regarding permissions to use the communication channels, i.e. defines which activities are forbidden.

In addition to controls prescribed by the Data Classification Policy, The Head of Infosec prescribes additional controls for each type of data and communication channel, based on risk assessment results.

Relations with External Parties
External parties include various service providers, companies for hardware and software maintenance, companies handling transactions or data processing, clients, etc.

Before exchanging information and/or software with any external party, an agreement should be signed, which is the responsibility of [Insert Company Name] Legal/Contracting. The agreement may be in paper or electronic form (e.g., agreeing to general terms and conditions) and must contain clauses in line with the risk assessment, including at least the following:
	•	Method of identification of the other party
	•	Authorizations to access information
	•	Ensuring non-repudiation
	•	Technical standards for data transfer
	•	Incident response
	•	Labeling and handling sensitive information
	•	Copyright

Agreements with external parties must be drawn up according to the Supplier Security Policy.

	•	Labeling of Information
The labeling of hardcopy and electronic media should be commensurate with the classification of the data and be easily recognizable. Place labels on exterior containers and at the beginning of the media based on the classification of the information.
	•	What Gets Labeled: The vast majority of [Insert Company Name] information falls into the Internal Use Only category. For this reason, it is not necessary to apply a label to such information. Information without a label is therefore by default classified as Internal Use Only. Other information may be labeled or tagged. Electronic data may be labeled but regardless of the labeling, must have the applied security controls based on the classification.
	•	Information Collections: Employees who create or update a collection of information are responsible for choosing an appropriate data classification label for the new or updated collection. This label should generally be the most restricted classification level found in the collection. Examples include a database, a management report, and an access-controlled web page.
	•	Labels for Sensitive External Information: Third-party information identified by its owner as sensitive should receive an appropriate [Insert Company Name] data classification label (e.g., third-party confidential information will also be considered [Insert Company Name] sensitive information). When assigned a classification label, copyright notices, author credits, guidelines for interpretation, and information about restricted dissemination must be preserved.
	•	Consistent Classification Labeling: If the information is sensitive, from the time it is created until it is destroyed or declassified, it should be labeled (marked) with an appropriate data classification designation. Such markings must appear on manifestations of the information, whether electronic or hardcopy.
	•	Storage Media: While [Insert Company Name] does not use removable media as part of its normal operations, if sensitive information is recorded on computer storage media (e.g., hard drives, USB keys, DVDs), it should be encrypted and/or protected by proper access controls. PCI and ePHI data must always be encrypted and may never be copied to local storage media when accessed remotely without the express prior authorization of the Information Security Team. 
	•	Labeling Sensitive Hardcopy: Printed, handwritten, or other paper manifestations of sensitive information must have a clearly evident classification label on each page. If bound, all sensitive information hardcopy must have an appropriate sensitivity label on the front cover and/or title page. The cover sheet for faxes containing sensitive information must also contain the appropriate classification label.  

	•	Management of Removable Media
Procedures for the management of removable media should be in accordance with the classification assigned to the data residing on the device. The procedures should follow these precepts:
	•	If no longer required, the contents of any re-usable media should be made unrecoverable;
	•	Management should authorize and document, for audit purposes, the removal of media from Company premises:
	•	Media should be stored in a safe, secure environment according to the manufacturer's specifications;
	•	Were the confidentiality and integrity of the data is paramount, appropriate cryptographic controls should be employed to protect the information on the device;
	•	Media owners should monitor the integrity of the device to minimize the risk of data degradation. Data should be transferred to new media, as deemed necessary, to avoid data loss;    
	•	Store a copy of sensitive information on separate media to reduce the risk of damage or loss.

Physical Media Transfer
	•	When transporting media containing sensitive information, protect the device against unauthorized access, misuse or corruption by following these guidelines:
	•	Use transportation methods or couriers which provides active tracking;
	•	A list of authorized couriers should be approved by management;
	•	Procedures verifying the identification of couriers should be enforced;
	•	Use sufficient packaging, in accordance with the manufacturer's specifications, to protect the contents from physical damage during transit.
	•	Maintain a log identifying media contents, the protection applied, the time of transfer to the courier and receipt at the destination.

Note:
Sensitive information residing on physical media should be encrypted before transport and the keys be transported separately. 

	•	Shipping and Handling
Use of Outside Services: Prior to sending any sensitive information to a third party for copying, printing, formatting, or other forms of handling requiring direct interaction with the information, the third party must sign a [Insert Company Name] NDA.

Back-Up Media: To prevent it from being revealed to or used by unauthorized parties, sensitive information recorded on back-up computer media (tapes, DVDs, USB keys, etc.) and stored outside [Insert Company Name] offices must be encrypted, with encryption keys stored safely in a manner approved by the Infosec department. If encryption cannot be used, password protections should be used.

Envelopes: If sensitive information is to be sent through external mail or by courier it must be enclosed in a sealed, opaque, secured envelope or container. The envelope or container must not indicate the classification of the nature of the information contained therein.  Envelopes or containers containing sensitive information must always be addressed to a specific person, and must also contain sufficient return address information.

Delivery of Hardcopy: Sensitive information in hardcopy must be personally delivered to the designated recipients, and not to an unattended desk, nor left out in the open in an unoccupied office. Alternatively, it may be made available to designated recipients via locked cabinets or similar physical security methods.

	•	Destruction and Disposal
Company records should be destroyed in accordance with [Insert Company Name]’s record retention practices. Sensitive information in electronic form should be wiped using industry standard software wiping or degaussing technology. Sensitive information in hardcopy format should be shredded, including transitory work products such as copies, drafts and notes. Production drives should be shredded via approved methods by preferred vendors. Audit trails of the production drives and certificates of destruction should be tracked and maintained.

Destruction Approval: Employees must not destroy or dispose of potentially important [Insert Company Name] records or information without specific advance management approval. Records and information must be retained if: (1) they are likely to be needed in the future, (2) regulation or statute requires their retention, or (3) they are likely to be needed for the investigation or prosecution of unauthorized, illegal, or abusive acts.

Retention Periods: Sensitive [Insert Company Name] information must be destroyed or disposed of when no longer needed. Information owners must review the data retention schedule issued by the legal department to determine the minimum legal periods that information must be retained. 

Destruction Methods: Sensitive information no longer being used may be placed in designated locked boxes until authorized [Insert Company Name] personnel or a bonded destruction service pick it up. Otherwise, sensitive information in hardcopy must be securely destroyed in a fashion approved by the security department.

7.9.1	Destruction and Disposal of Equipment and Media
Data and licensed software stored on removable media (e.g., on CD, DVD, USB flash drive, memory card, etc. but also on paper) and on equipment containing storage media (e.g., computers, mobile phones, etc.) must be erased or the medium destroyed before it is disposed of or reused.

The person responsible for erasing data / destroying media must inform the owner of the asset in question about erasing/destroying, and the asset owner must update the Inventory of Assets.

Equipment
The Head of Engineering Operations and/or the Head of Information Technology are responsible for checking and erasing data from equipment, unless the Data Classification Policy prescribes differently. Data should be erased using processes described in DoD 5220.22-M, but if the process is not secure enough considering the sensitivity of the data, then the storage medium must be destroyed.

Removable Storage Media
The Head of Information Technology is responsible for erasing data from removable/mobile storage media, unless the Data Classification Policy prescribes differently. Data must be erased using processes described in DoD 5220.22-M, but if the erasure process is not secure enough considering the sensitivity of the data, then the storage medium must be destroyed.

Paper Media
Employees of the organization handling individual documents are responsible for destroying paper documents, unless the Data Classification Policy prescribes differently. Paper documents are destroyed by paper shredders.

Erasure and Destruction Records; Commission for the Destruction of Data
Records of erasure/destruction must be kept for data classified as "Restricted." Records must include the following information: information about the media, date of erasure/destruction, method of erasure/destruction, person who carried out the process.

Information classified as "Restricted" must also only be erased/destroyed in the presence of a commission consisting of persons authorized to access the information in question.

	•	Breach Disclosure of Sensitive Information
information security problems (or potential problems) should be reported immediately to InfoSec. Timely reporting will allow the Security team to determine if further investigation is necessary and to limit any further damage or loss of data. See the Incident Response Procedure for additional guidance.

	•	Communications Security
When transferring information through communications facilities (i.e., email, voice, facsimile, video, or downloading), ensure controls are in place to protect the information from interception, copying, modification, misrouting, and destruction. Additionally, the data should be protected against malware transmitted through electronic communications. Staff should take appropriate precautions to prevent the disclosure of sensitive information.

Agreements on data transfer between [Insert Company Name] and third-party business partners or suppliers should include:
	•	Responsibilities for dispatch and receipt of information;
	•	Minimum technical standards for packaging and transmission;
	•	Courier identification standards;
	•	Handling security incidents;
	•	Labeling of information;
	•	Technical standards for recording and reading information and software;
	•	Cryptographic controls;
	•	Chain of custody while in transit;
	•	Any special controls required to protect sensitive information.

Information sent via electronic messaging should be protected from unauthorized access, modification or denial of service based on the classification of the data. Staff should ensure correct addressing and the reliability of the messaging service as well as any legal considerations (e.g., requirements for electronic signatures) when preparing messages for electronic transmission.

Note:
Staff should only use [Insert Company Name]-approved external public services (e.g., instant messaging, social networking or file sharing) to send messages.

Staff members must sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) in order to communicate/handle [Insert Company Name]’s sensitive information.

	•	Application Services
Protecting information on public networks is essential to the security of [Insert Company Name], their business partners and suppliers. The level of protection required to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive information should have the approval of the parties involved. Application service arrangements with SaaS vendors should have documented agreements detailing the requirements for protecting the application servers and ensuring the availability of network connectivity. The agreement should include authorization processes, cryptographic controls to be used, and a reference to any laws and regulations applicable to the jurisdictions involved.    

A detailed risk assessment should be performed to ensure the applications are adequately protected from a range of threats (e.g., fraudulent activities, contract disputes, disclosure of information, etc.) associated with public networks.

Protecting SaaS Transactions
Encryption of SaaS transactions should be a high priority to safeguard information transmitted over public networks. Transactions and communication paths should be encrypted and digital signatures/certificates integrated throughout the entire process, to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the information. Communication protocols should be secure and transactions stored in an environment protected from public access, in accordance with local laws and regulations.

	•	Third Party Interactions
Third Parties and the Need to Know: Unless designated as public, [Insert Company Name] internal information must be protected from disclosure to third parties. Third parties may be given access to [Insert Company Name] internal information only when a demonstrable need-to-know exists, and when such disclosure has been expressly authorized by the relevant [Insert Company Name] information owner. Disclosures of sensitive [Insert Company Name] information to third parties must be accompanied with a signed non-disclosure agreement (NDA). Such disclosure of sensitive information should be accompanied by a log (e.g., email trail) indicating what information was provided, when, and to whom.
